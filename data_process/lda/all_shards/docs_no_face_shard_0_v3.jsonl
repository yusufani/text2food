and which she manipulates.", "Instead of using prefabricated canvases, Dole- Recio usually creates her own surfaces: she collages paper, various kinds of cardboard, and fabric to produce a substratum on which she paints, only to deconstruct the result by carving into it.", "The saturation and composition of the colors contribute as much to the quality of her work as the depth of the positive and negative spaces she uncovers with the stencil knife.", "Lecia Dole-Recio lives in Los Angeles, where she teaches at the renowned Art Center in Pasadena and CalArts in Valencia, CA.", "In this Secession exhibition the artist presents a selection of her latest works.", "The conditions of painting as a medium as well as the history of abstraction are important points of reference for Lecia Dole-Recio\u2019s artistic practice.", "Her visual compositions are marked by complex layerings of various materials: canvas, cardboard, paper, and paint.", "In the volumes created in this way, the artist makes precise cuts and thus works from the visual support.", "Geometrical shapes are arranged in organic-seeming constellations and patterns that have an affect on the space around them.", "In this Secession exhibition, her first show in Austria, Lecia Dole-Recio presents a selection of her latest works.", "The exploration of a spatial perception of painting that is manifest in her previous oeuvre is expanded in these most recent works by adding a temporal component.", "The artist here uses the remains and scraps of earlier work processes, negative images, as it were, of already existing works that she collages and treats in her usual manner.", "In so doing, not only does she suspend the distinction between \u201cvaluable\u201d material and waste, but also underscores the variety and processuality of her art.", "It becomes clear that an artist like Dole-Recio takes the abstract painting as a starting point, but in the meantime deconstructs it using the theoretical and formal stock of installation.", "This is visible in a quite literal sense already in her early works: fragile paper elements and other materials are applied to the canvas, the clarity and stability that we know from past abstract painting seems to have dissolved, the sensual impression is on first glance often more comparable to a Calder mobile than to painting.", "The paintings are not bound to the canvas, their materiality dissipates in the space around them.", "Lecia Dole-Recio, born in San Francisco in 1971, lives and works in Los Angeles."], "image_info": [{"image_name": "6ef936b5fc5a.jpg",

four floors of a mixed-use, former medical building in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, the school serves as a \u201chome away from home\u201d for its kids, featuring flexible spaces and playful palettes that encourage creative self-expression and pride at all ages.", "The Blue School opened last month for its inaugural semester, welcoming 100 students and 70 faculty members through its shiny glass doors under a neon sign signaling its presence in the neighborhood.", "The 45,000-square-foot facility is the New York-based institution\u2019s second campus designed by Rockwell Group.", "It provides much-needed breathing room for the school\u2019s fourth through eighth-grade levels, which were previously housed in what\u2019s now the primary school located in the South Street Seaport.", "Thanks to the move, pre-kindergarten through third-grade students were also given more space inside their facility, which opened in 2010.", "Upon walking through the doors of the new Blue School, students, teachers, and guests are greeted with a lobby sporting a lounge-like feel, as well a high-gloss, neon yellow central staircase that serves as the main point of circulation in the facility.", "To the left in a community space called the Commons, colorful outdoor furniture adds a contemporary twist to the cafeteria setting along with bleacher-like seating wrapped in wood and staggered along the walls for a topographical effect.", "Additionally, a bar with stools lines the edge of the 1,800-square-foot space overlooking the street.", "The Commons also includes walls lined with LED-lit garden planters where food is grown as part of the school\u2019s science curriculum as well as for students\u2019 meals.", "The living wall is maintained in partnership with Brooklyn Grange and enhances the living room-like atmosphere of the shared space.", "On the basement level, Rockwell Group created a grown-up version of their Imagination Playground system with which students can construct their own seating stations using shapely, blue-foam cushions.", "The surrounding walls are clad with colorful, geometric wallpaper by Flavor Paper.", "Two studios as well as a column-free gymnasium, which doubles as a 130-seat auditorium\u2014the Blue School\u2019s first ever performance space\u2014were also designed for the school\u2019s arts and exercise programs.", "If flexibility is an integral part of the Blue School\u2019s educational philosophy and its interior architectural design, the concept is most evident on the top floors where each learning space includes key elements that allow teachers and students to take over space how they see fit.", "Rockwell Group collaborated with Uhuru to create non-directional trapezoidal desks that can be easily set up to form clusters for group-work situations.", "Each classroom also includes a raised carpeted platform dedicated to quiet reading or presentations.", "An art room, maker lab, and materials library were also given major space on the second floor.", "Both are fully stocked with every kind of arts and engineering supply imaginable, from paint brushes to saws, to glue and glass.", "An adjacent materials library\u2014open to the kids at all times\u2014serves several fields of study and specific STEAM courses.", "The Blue School\u2019s library features a book-lined, double-height reading space with a massive sofa and custom common tables by Rockwell Group for Knoll.", "Hanging from the ceiling next to the curtain-wall window is a light sculpture designed in collaboration with Dot Dash Design.", "It changes colors throughout the day and amplifies the school\u2019s interior at night.", "From the street level, passersby can see activity within the facility and students get a sense of inclusion in the bustling neighborhood.", "Since the Blue School began in 2006, it has added one grade level per year to its roster of students\u2014hence the need to build out a new campus for its burgeoning population.", "The first group of kids to begin at the school recently graduated from 8th grade and though they never had the chance to move into the new Upper School, they were integrated into the extensive planning process that Rockwell Group held with students, parents, and teachers.", "The school expects the number of students to double over the next several years.", "Blue School will featured as an Open Access site during Open House New York this Saturday, October 13th.", "Check it out from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. or go on a guided tour with representatives from Blue School and Rockwell

single species, Cryolophosaurus ellioti.", "They are the second among all the dinosaurs (with the first one being the herbivorous Antarctopelta), and the first among the meat-eating dinosaurs to be discovered on the frozen continent of Antarctica.", "However, these were odd looking dinosaurs fairly large by size for such an early hunter, and are primarily known for their small curved crest on the top of their heads.", "It was during the summer of the southern hemisphere between 1990 and 1991 that the cryolophosaurus was the prehistoric creature was discovered on Mount Kirkpatrick of the Transantarctic Mountains in the Beardmore Glacier region\u2019s siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation by American paleontologist William Roy Hammer and his team of researchers.", "The fossilized specimens that were unearthed dated back to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic period.", "Later in 1991, David Elliot, a geologist from Ohio, along with Hammer, discovered further remains of the cryolophosaurus in a rock formation close to the Beardmore Glacier at the height of 4,000 m (13,000 feet).", "The site was approximately 640 km (400 miles) from Antarctica (South Pole).", "Soon after, Hammer and the entire team discovered over 100 rocks bearing fossils of prehistoric life in the following three weeks, including those of cryolophosaurus, and weighing almost around 2300 kg (5,000 pounds) in total.", "The discovered fossils included parts like backbone, crushed skulls, as well as the jaw, hip, leg, foot and ankle bones.", "In 1994, William Hammer and William Hickerson described these specimens, naming them formally as Cryolophosaurus ellioti in the science journal \u2013 \u2018Science\u2019.", "The generic name of the then newly-described creature derived from the Greek words kryos (cold), lofos (crest or mount), and savros (lizard).", "The specific name was in honor of David Elliot, an Australian scientist who initially discovered the fossils of the creature.", "The reptile measured between 6 and 8 meters (20 to 26 feet).", "They had a high and narrow skull (head) measuring about 65 cm (25 inches) with a typical wrinkled, nasal crest running just above their eyes, from where it rises perpendicularly, fanning out with comb-like appearance.", "The cryolophosaurus had a small brain.", "It had many sharp and pointed teeth lining their strong jaws adapted enough to tear flesh and rip the prey apart.", "Also, they may have had feathers; however, the scientists are not certain about it as yet.", "While other species of theropods like the Monolophosaurus also had head crests, they usually ran parallel to the sides of the skull instead of across it.", "The real purpose of this crest, however, still remains a mystery.", "The crest of the cryolophosaurus was too fragile to be used in combat, and, almost certainly, they were used in courtship or mating displays.", "During the time the cryolophosaurus lived, the continent of Antarctica looked quite different.", "It was probably a collection of islands during the Mesozoic period and used to be quite close to the equator.", "It even possibly had its own forest areas, where these dinos preferred to live.", "The cryolophosaurus were territorial, and their crests were used for displaying inter-territorial or breeding contests.", "Also, the weather pattern of the continent was milder than it presently withstands, and these huge creatures learned to bear the climatic anomalies \u2013 a wet temperate forest with daylight dominated summers and dark, cold winters.", "Scientists believe that the females were more likely to get attracted to the males with larger and flashier head crests.", "Hence, such males came into conflict more frequently.", "These carnivores probably preyed upon the glacialisaurus, especially the young or the sick ones, that shared its habitat.", "Perhaps, they also scavenged the corpses of other dead animals after their death of natural causes.", "The cryolophosaurus has earned the nickname Elvisaurus for its forward-leaning pompadour head crest \u2018resembling\u2019 the hairstyle of the legendary pop star Elvis Presley.", "The cryolophosaurus was a member of the group of bipedal dinosaurs that included the ancestors of birds, and was not closely related to the lizards.", "A recurring character on the Public Broadcasting Service\u2019s Dinosaur Train is known as \u2018King Cryolophosaurus\u2019.", "Cryolophosaurus was the largest carnivorous dinosaur of its time, and was probably the apex predator of the early

beers, even some that Bryan was developing while he was at The Post.", "Upon arriving at The Post, we were welcomed with the first two beers: Dogfish Head\u2019s Super 8 Super Gose and The Post\u2019s Howdy Beer Western Pilsner.", "The two were paired with a rich and extremely delicious lobster roll.", "Each of the beers brings a unique pairing to the dish; one with an acidity that cuts the richness, and the other with a sweetness that embraces the roll.", "It was tough to pick a \u201cbetter\u201d pairing between the two, but this appetizer course was only just the beginning.", "The first course, and the first official pairing of the night, was titled Love Letter to Bryan Selders.", "The dish was a scrapple, made with a sunny-side up quail egg and a smoked tomato sauce.", "It was paired with Dogfish Head\u2019s The Big Yellow One Pilsner and the Post\u2019s Ski Tan.", "Each highlighted and complemented the dish in their own way.", "Ski Tan\u2019s smokiness enhanced the smoked tomato sauce, and was balanced out by the scrapple.", "On the other hand, The Big Yellow One Pilsner complimented all the flavors of the scrapple.", "Essentially, the Pilsner would be a great breakfast beer to go with a traditionally breakfast dish.", "The second course was a seared scallop over an asparagus salad, with a spring vegetable salsa verde, topped with fingerling potato chips.", "This dish was outstanding and delicate.", "Bryan paired it with Dogfish Head\u2019s Drangons and Yum Yum, which was part of their collaboration series with musicians.", "This particular beer was a collaboration with The Flaming Lips.", "Nick paired it with The Post\u2019s GSD.", "We enjoyed how the fruity notes complimented the scallops, We also enjoyed how the lightness of GSD embraces the delicate nature of the scallop, while adding some breadiness from the malt character.", "The third course of the night was a Philly Cheesesteak Beef Wellington with a smoked cheddar sauce.", "Like the other courses, it was absolutely delicious.", "This course was paired with Dogfish Head\u2019s Aprihop IPA, which is a classic, and The Post\u2019s #knowfilter.", "Like the other courses that preceded it, each brought out different flavors of the dish.", "This was a round in which it was a unanimously difficult decision to pick which pairing came out on top.", "This was a great showcase of the Battle of the Brewmasters.", "The evening ended with the dessert course, which was a Boston Cream Pie in a mason jar.", "This was paired with Siracusa Nera from Dogfish Head and Big Rosie from the Post.", "While describing the pairing, Nick shared that Big Rosie is one of the pastry chef\u2019s favorite beers, so it was fitting to pair the Boston Cream Pie with this beer.", "Each of the beers brought a unique pairing with the dessert.", "The wine flavors of Siracusa Nera enhanced the richness of the dessert.", "On the other hand, the coffee and roasty notes in Big Rosie balanced out the sweetness of the cream pie.", "It was tough to pick an overall favorite, since each beer brought out something different in each dish.", "The main highlight, I would say, is seeing the camaraderie and banter between Bryan and Nick.", "Not to mention, the thought process they went through to pick the beers that they paired Brett\u2019s dishes with."], "image_info": [{"image_name":

live bait, there are several options available.", "Spinners and spoons in particular can be very successful, because the Salmon respond so well to anything shiny.", "The main thing to keep in mind is that Salmon are bottom feeders, so whatever weight setup you prefer, you\u2019ll need to keep your lure bouncing slightly along the bottom.", "If you had to pick just one lure to go with, our favorite

"We have designed these fresh and stylish seed bead bracelets especially for beginners.", "They are the perfect project through which to learn some of the most basic beading techniques whilst gaining confidence in your design choices.", "What\u2019s more, whilst these gorgeous glass bead creations look as striking as they do chic, our little secret is that they won\u2019t break the bank.", "The entire project can be put together for under \u00a38.", "Wow!", "That\u2019s pretty amazing when you consider that these bracelets are made using only genuine Czech glass seed beads; the same beautiful, traditional beads that have been made by artisan glassworkers in the Czech Republic since 1870.", "Czech glass seed beads are a plump, rounded \u2018Taurus\u2019 (ring-doughnut) shape.", "Their gentle curves give a glorious fluidity to jewellery which also makes for an incredibly tactile and easy-to-wear statement piece.", "Our glass seed beads come in three different sizes as illustrated below.", "Our seed bead bracelets can be created using either two or three different sizes of seed bead (Size 5/0 is 4.5mm, size 9/0 is 2.5mm and size 11/0 is 2mm).", "Seed bead sizing uses a traditional sizing system, but the basic rule of thumb is that the bigger the number, the smaller the bead.", "Design choices \u2013 over to you!", "So here\u2019s where the fun begins!", "Once you have decided whether you would like to work with two or three bead sizes, it\u2019s time to choose your bead colours.", "Maybe you want to make a bracelet to match a certain outfit or reflect a season or mood, or to give as a gift to someone who loves to wear red, for example?", "Whatever your inspiration, now is the time to browse our seed bead directory and pick out your three packs of beads to suit your brief.", "Don\u2019t forget to use the handy colour picker on the LHS of the screen to narrow your selection.", "To add further depth and interest to your bracelet, you can also play around with matt effects, glossy textures and metallic or rainbow finishes.", "Be bold and have fun!", "Colourways \u2013 a helping hand.", "If you\u2019ve had a look at our seed bead directory and are baffled by choice, then don\u2019t panic!", "We\u2019ve created some fabulous online colourway sets (that\u2019s design speak for \u2018colour combinations\u2019!)", "specifically for this bracelet design.", "We hope these sets will help to narrow down colour and style combinations whilst still allowing you bags of personal design choice.", "After you\u2019ve browsed our seed bead directory and colourways sets and have picked out a combination to suit your personal style, then away you go.", "We hope you love this little seed bead project and its stunning finished piece as much as we do!", "Don\u2019t forget to download our printable bracelet instructions to help you on your way, and, as you work through the project, remember to keep referring to our online video which walks you through the entire project and should help iron out any stumbling blocks.", "The beauty of this little project is that the only other accessory you will need in order to create your bracelet\u2013 aside from your three packets of seed beads \u2013 is some jewellery elastic cord.", "It really couldn\u2019t be simpler.", "Once you\u2019ve bought your beads and made your first bracelet, you can easily use any left-over beads to create matching earrings, or a simple ring or necklace.", "Your journey into the vibrant and intoxicating world of jewellery making has only just begun!", "We want to know how you got on with this project.", "We\u2019d love you to upload pictures of your completed seed bead bracelets to our Facebook page, or comment below to let us know how easy (or otherwise!)", "you found it.", "Enjoy, and happy beading!", "Kate, Jonathan and all the team at Boundless Beads.", "P.S.", "If you\u2019re not quite ready to take the plunge into jewellery-making yourself, but know of someone who loves to craft and be creative, then one of our colourways sets and a printed set of our bracelet instructions would make a fabulously unusual gift."], "image_info": [{"image_name":

more than one way to skin a cat.", "However I am going to talk about some of the dos and don\u2019ts for narrow windrow burning.", "Although at this point you cannot do anything about chaff windrows that have already been produced what you will see is that windrows from a well set up header will have withstood considerable amounts of rain over summer and still be ready to burn.", "The windrow you can see below has had over 100 mm of rain between harvest and burning.", "Windrows that aren't over-threshed remain open and aerated like this one.", "Chaff still on top of windrow despite 100 mm rain.Things to note are that the windrow appears prickly and this shows that during harvest the straw was not over threshed.", "This has allowed the chaff portion to remain high in the windrow which also aids drying after rain.", "The crop was harvested at a height of approximately 10 cm.", "Another critical factor in burning windrows is the meteorological conditions when you start burning.", "Starting the burn when the FDI is about 7 which in this case was about 18:00.The use of a fire danger index (FDI) has made stubble burning more of a science than a mystical art.", "The FDI is determined by temperature, humidity, wind speed and dryness of the fuel.", "These need to be measured and put into the fire index app to calculate FDI.", "This means that you need a weather meter, either hand-held or cab mounted, and your mobile phone with the app installed.", "A very useful app for both Android and Apple is Fire Tools by Mountain Pine Studios.", "Doug Smith measuring wind speed, temperature and humidity to feed into the fire app.", "Also use the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s MetEye\u00ae site for monitoring local predicted changes to wind speed and direction so you can decide whether to press on or call it a night.", "Starting when the fire index is too high means that the file will rarely stay in the windrow and the fire will burn significant portions of the paddock.", "See image below.", "Too low and the windrows won\u2019t burn as hot as needed to kill weed seeds in the row.", "Conditions change by the hour so keep measuring conditions as well as knowing what is coming for the next couple of days before you light up.", "Check for smouldering rows early the next day so they can be dealt with before the day heats up.", "There has been a lot of talk and promotion of harvest weed seed management to keep a lid on cropping weed numbers and when done properly it does work.", "Unfortunately it is human nature to hear the pieces of a message that appeals to us and we don\u2019t give heed to the full story.", "The burning of narrow windrows appears to fall into this category.", "Recently there have been some runaway fires which have damaged fences, stubble cover, dry pastures, remnant native bushland amongst other things.", "Luckily no one was injured or killed and livestock losses were also low.", "These incidents lead to difficult relations with neighbours and incur added costs and lost opportunities.", "Stubble burnt from escaped burn.", "Loss of groundcover will create crop establishment problems with possible loss of crop yield.Sally Peltzer from the Department of Agriculture & Food WA has just put out a timely reminder in the latest edition of e-Weed of the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of successful windrow burning.", "Using the McArthur Fire Index, or if you are a hipster with an iPhone, the Pocketfire\u00ae app, are good places to start to tell you the conditions are suitable to get a good burn that kills weed seeds but can still be contained.", "Look at three and 10 day weather forecasts to get an idea of likely wind directions and speeds.", "Remember basic fire safety.", "Never light fires alone and without fire fighting gear primed and ready.", "Light the rows every 50 to 75 m depending on the conditions.", "Light into the breeze or have a cross breeze.", "Don\u2019t light the up wind side and hope for the best.", "Normally there is about a 3 hour optimum time every day to burn narrow windrows and aim to have them out by 10 pm.", "Check again next morning to put out any smouldering

survived, reached its objective, and is wowing scientists with results.", "Its engine blew up seven years ago, and by all rights the Japanese spacecraft Akatsuki shouldn't have survived.", "However, engineers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) refused to give up.", "The spacecraft not only survived its deep-space catastrophe, but it's now safely in orbit around Venus and producing breathtaking images of swirling clouds at multiple levels within the planet's dense atmosphere that have never been glimpsed before.", "Scientists from the European Space Agency's Venus Express

Venus and enter orbit on December 6, 2010, using an innovative ceramic thruster.", "Unfortunately, the crucial engine firing failed in dramatic fashion, when inadequate pressurant flow into the engine caused the thruster temperature to increase until the nozzle cracked.", "The spacecraft autonomously shut down its broken engine only partway through the intended orbit insertion burn, and it sailed right past Venus.", "After determining that the engine wasn't salvageable, the resourceful team at JAXA vented all the remaining propellant to lighten the spacecraft and developed a brave plan to attempt orbit entry a second time.", "To make a long and dramatic story short, they succeeded.", "Akatsuki has been at Venus since December 9, 2015, and in its final science orbit since April 4, 2016.", "This very elliptical orbit has a period of 10.5 days, traveling from a periapsis of around 10,000 km to an apoapsis of 360,000 km.", "Project scientist Takeshi Imamura likens the mission to a

images are more sensitive to the presence of sulfur dioxide SO2) that rises from lower down, surviving in the upper atmosphere only briefly before solar ultraviolet radiation breaks it up and atmospheric chemistry recombines it into other molecules.", "Akatsuki's IR2 camera acquired this view of the night side of Venus.", "Infrared energy from hot, mid-altitude clouds shows up bright, while higher clouds that block the heat appear dark.", "The dark sawtooth at center appears to be a turbulent boundary.", "The planet's sunlit crescent is overexposed at upper right.", "The infrared cameras (IR1 and IR2) need no sunlight to see Venus.", "They observe in wavelengths at which the hot atmosphere radiates thermally.", "IR2 has two channels, 1.74 and 2.26 microns, which detect heat at a still-high 48 to 55 km above the surface.", "Seen at these wavelengths, dark features are higher-altitude clouds that block Akatsuki's view of the glow of the warm atmosphere lower down.", "Researchers suspect that the motions of clouds at these mid-level altitudes are more sensitive to topography lying far below.", "Unfortunately, the two infrared cameras (IR1 and IR2) suffered an electrical fault in December 2016.", "But the long-wave infrared (LIR) imager, Lyman-alpha camera (LAC), and ultraviolet imager (UVI) all still function.", "Late in 2017, the mission made its first release of science data to the Akatsuki data archive.", "That's when Damia Bouic, an amateur image processor in France, delved into the raw image files and surfaced with the data that she used to make

a great story on the @OhJoy Instagram recently where founder Joy Cho spelled out how she goes about influencer gifting.", "She has an awesome new line of fun and colorful paper goods that she created along with Cheeky (at Target), so here are her thoughts on how to gift your products successfully!", "Be sure to check out my other favorite Oh Joy collaborations here, like the fun hat box suitcase that I\u2019ve been loving!", "1.", "Research the best fit for your products.", "Make sure that blogger\u2019s style aligns with the aesthetic of your products.", "Can you really envision them using and loving your products?", "Try to mix it up so you don\u2019t always gift to the same people.", "My two cents: Try to find people that are already sharing about your products or similar types of products.", "They are even more likely to share if they are already a fan.", "2.", "Reach out to make sure they\u2019re interested.", "Narrow your list to 5-10 people to gift product to, then email them to make sure they are open to receiving your product.", "You\u2019ll have to email them anyway for their address, but this gives them the opportunity to politely decline if someone passes- they are just being respectful of you if they know it\u2019s not a good fit for them.", "3.", "Wow them with your package.", "It\u2019s all in the presentation!", "Do a creative wrapping job, send it in a colorful bubble wrap with fun tissue paper, etc.", "Include a postcard or something with your branding along with a hand-written note.", "This is a great way to share where people can buy your product and any relevant tags/hashtags you are hoping they\u2019ll share.", "4.", "Have no expectations.", "If you\u2019re not offering to pay for them promoting your items, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect a blog or Instagram post.", "When you reach out, let them know that there are no strings attached so they will feel like they can share it in a way that\u2019s as natural as possible.", "My two cents: When I\u2019ve given my products to bloggers with smaller followings, I\u2019ve gotten a bigger return on the type of content they share.", "For example, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll get a dedicated Instagram post or blog post from a blogger who is just starting out.", "With larger influencers, I usually only expect an Instagram story or to be tagged alongside the other brands they might be getting paid to promote.", "You never know- if they really love it they might share in a big way, but this has been my experience when gifting my Turkish towels.", "5.", "Just keep your fingers crossed that they will love it and share it in some way!", "Typically influencers that know something is coming ahead of time will usually share in some way.", "It can be great to reach out to bloggers, and other times they might reach out to ask for your products.", "If you aren't comfortable gifting, the best way to decline (well, the way that I most like being turned down) is to say that you have already reached your gifting budget/limit for the time being.", "Try following Joy\u2019s steps if you're doing the \"pitching\", and it will most likely help you spread the word about your awesome products!", "If you enjoy learning about entrepreneurship, blogging, and social media, read more free resources in the Social Media University section of my site."], "image_info":
